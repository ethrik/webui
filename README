atheme-web - an actually working web interface for Services
-----------------------------------------------------------

Due to popular demand, we have created a web interface for Atheme.  Total
development time so far: about 4 hours.

Some things are working, other things are not yet.  Code is accepted.

Requirements
------------

Python Paste (Debian: python-paste)
Python 2.5 or later

Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. Make sure services has XMLRPC enabled.

2. $EDITOR athemeweb/config.py, edit config values appropriately.

3. Optionally change static/style.css and static/logo.png.  I for one,
   do not think you are the StaticBox IRC network.

4. python launch.py

5. Enjoy.

In reality, you probably want to use mod_wsgi or something.  You can find
a mod_wsgi configuration script at atheme-web.wsgi.  Then you want to do
something like:

    WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/atheme-web/atheme-web.wsgi

You MUST edit the atheme-web.wsgi so that it can find the application
modules.  Instructions are included inside the atheme-web.wsgi file.

Running atheme-web with launch.py is insecure (it puts the application
into development mode) and not recommended.

Do NOT run atheme-web as root.

TODO
----

Mostly the channel integration and account tab need to be finished up.  We
are also interested in ALIS integration for obvious reasons.

Bugs
----

Report bugs to http://jira.atheme.org/ against the SRVWEB (Atheme Services - Web)
component.
